                e-tutoring, the scope for one-on-one interaction is much higher.
                That is why we preferred this mode. We had to bring my son up to
                speed in subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Maths
                and I must say we are happy with the progress so far. &nbsp;

                tutoring offers a lot of flexibility. This is all the more
                important because my son plays golf at the under-18 level in the
                UAE. So, flexibility in the terms of tuition timings is
                important. Given the option, we would have even gone for home
                schooling for Aryaan. &nbsp;
