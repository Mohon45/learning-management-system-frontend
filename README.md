# E-Tutors

[https://e-tutors-ada6f.web.app/](https://e-tutors-ada6f.web.app/).

1. I have built a learning management system called E-Tutors using React, Bootstrap, Node.JS, Express.JS, MongoDB, Cloudinary, Etc.
2. Both students and teachers can use this system, but there will be some feature differences between them.
3. From here, students can find tutors for their specific subjects and check their preparation through online tests.

## Its full process is described below.

### `Step-1:`

First of all, any user has to register to enter the application. At the time of registration, there will be a special field where the user type has to be selected. Basically, there will be 2 types of users, a teacher and a student. By which we can understand whether the user is a student or a teacher.

### `Step-2:`

Registration and login will take them to their profile to update their profile. From there they can update their profile. For example:-
In the case of the teacher, all the details of the teacher such as his identity, what subject he is a teacher of, what position he is currently working in, how to contact him, etc.
In case of students, which class they belong to, their address, name of guardians, their contact details, etc.

### `Step-3:`

After updating the profile they will move to the dashboard. From there, if the students select the subject of their own class, the list of teachers of that subject will appear. From there they can select the teacher of their choice. And from there you can contact those teachers.

### `Step-4:`

After that students can check their preparation through an online test. When multiple-choice questions will be given to them, they will answer as they like and at the end, they will see their results.

### `Step-5:`

Then there is a section called notes for them from where they will get suggestion notes for each of their subjects. They can also view and download from there if they want.

### `Step-6:`

There is another section called WorkSheet for students. Where they can share their ideas, create groups, join live sessions, and more.
